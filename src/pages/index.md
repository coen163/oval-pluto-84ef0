    content: >
      7 years of experiences in Customer services working as Helpdesk, but long
      ago I started my career in the Tech world, with my first tech degree in
      computer assembly and programming when I was 14 years old, I develop a
      passion for the technology more likely in the computer repair field.


      Now I find my self in the world of programming technologies, and studying
      in Cenfotec, where I recently got a superior technical degree in software
      development, personally I did this to complement my certificates in Web
      development.


      Udemy and Freecodecamp are the pilars of my journey where I started to
      discover the love for programming
